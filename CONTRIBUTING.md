PR 'Guidelines'
-------------
When working on a branch, feel free to commit as often as you'd like (we think more often is better than less often!). When you think your PR is ready to be merged into master and you're looking for a final review, we encourage squashing your commits into one commit and creating a clear commit message following [Tim Pope's model for git commit messages](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html). Please then pull the latest from master and rebase so that your change is kept on top. If you have any questions, again - feel free to reach out by @ 'ing any of the contributors below.

# Gatherto [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/daveshah/gatherto.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/daveshah/gatherto)

Inspired by the fact that [97% of the time, I run alone](http://goo.gl/KP8uIO)

My hope is that this will scratch 2 of my current itches:  
- A desire to dig deeper into Phoenix & Elixir by building something a bit larger scale  
- I want a tool that allows me to find other folks to run and bike with.  


I have some basic ideas for features I'd like to see in this. If you have any, I'd love to hear them - just create a new issue :).
